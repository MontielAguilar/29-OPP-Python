# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Exercises in Python

This repository contains a series of practical exercises to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python.

## Exercise 1: Basic Class with Attributes and Basic Methods:

The `exercise1.py` file contains the definition of a `Vehicle` class with `max_speed` and `mileage` attributes, along with two methods: `get_max_speed()` and `increase_mileage(ammount_to_increase)`. This exercise demonstrates how to create a basic class and work with its attributes and methods.

## Exercise 2: Class with Attributes and Methods:

In the `exercise2.py` file, the `Rectangle` class is defined, representing a rectangle with length and width attributes. The class also includes methods to calculate the perimeter and area of the rectangle, as well as a method to display the details of the rectangle.

## Exercise 3: More Advanced Class with Attributes and Methods:

The `exercise3.py` file introduces the `BankAccount` class, representing a bank account. The class includes methods for managing deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and applying bank fees. It also implements methods for displaying account details and comparing bank accounts by balance.

## Exercise 4: Class Inheritance:

In `exercise4.py`, an example of class inheritance in Python is shown. The `Vehicle` class is defined as a base class and the `Bus` class as a child class inheriting from `Vehicle`. The `fare()` method is overridden to apply an additional fee for buses.

## Exercise 5: Exception Handling

The `exercise5.py` file implements an interactive calculator in Python that handles user input errors using exceptions. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations and handle errors such as incorrect formulas or division by zero.

## Exercise 6: Further Exception Handling

In `exercise6.py`, the exception handling from the previous exercise is extended. Child classes of `FormulaError` are created to handle specific errors, such as incorrect numeric values, invalid operators, and incorrect number of arguments.
